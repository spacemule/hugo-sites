I'm Noah. I was born a yankee, raised a Texan, and now I'm  Israeli. Please enjoy the photograph of my family that can be found to the left.

My interests include Linux system administration, containerization, automation, cooking, country music history and folklore, and dogs.

[Here is my origin story.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220108183728/https://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/ur1zc/i_am_an_intergalatic_space_mule_i_unwittingly/)

Please enjoy the photograph of my dog, Maya, on the right.
